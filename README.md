## Demo Workflow

This demo showcases my automated test script for an e-commerce application:

1. **Add products dynamically** to the cart using **Java Streams** to iterate over an array of items.  
2. **Cart page validations:**  
   - Verify that the correct products were added  
   - Calculate and assert **total amount**  
   - Validate **discounted total** after applying promo code  
3. **Checkout process:**  
   - Select **Philippines** as the country  
   - Tick the **Terms and Conditions** checkbox  
   - Click the **Place Order** button  
4. **Confirmation page:**  
   - Capture and assert the **Thank You** message displayed after placing the order
